    <h2>Joshua Bell</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Josh or Joshua and I'm 32. Me and my son moved to Oklahoma 10 years ago. Shortly after moving from Southeastern Idaho, I found a job at a local internet provider. I have been there ever since. My boss a few years ago asked me where I wanted to be in 5 years and then in 10 years, I didn't have an answer and pondered on it for several months. After about a year of trying to start a new career, I kept getting turned down due to lack of a degree in programming. I started looking for schools and BYU-Pathways kept popping up. We were on a family vacation talking about schools, and heading to the Washington DC visitor center, and it popped up again. So, I took it as a sign and clicked the link. I was applying late, about a week before classes started, and I ended up getting in that semester. It has been a very fulfilling journey so far and a path that has felt right.</p>
    <p>I am married, we both came into the relationship with 1 child, so now I have a son and a daughter. I was blessed to be able to baptize my wife and daughter last year. I didn't go on a mission, so it was a unique experience for me to be able to baptise entire family. We also were blessed with 2 amazing puppies earlier this year, they make my family feel very complete now. You can usually find at least one if not all of us with some form of electronic in our hands, we all love video games and movies, we also spend a lot of time outdoors taking pictures, or building things.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me.</p>
