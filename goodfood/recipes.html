            Making food from your garden is a relatively easy process compared to the work that was put into growing and harvesting it.

                A simple recipe to make with the vegetables that come from a home garden is a sheet pan dinner. The recipe I have used in the past is a mix of vegetables: broccoli, potatoes, green beans, bell peppers, cauliflower, and minced garlic. I usually go buy a smoked turkey sausage, and just cut it and the vegetables into bite sized pieces. Put on a sheet pan, add some finely cut parsley and oregano, and drizzle some extra virgin oil, and salt and pepper on the pile of food. Hand toss to coat everything evenly, and put in the oven at 400 until the vegetables are soft, stirring at least once during the cooking. Then just sprinkle some parmesan cheese over it and the meal is done with very little work or effort.

                Something that was a staple from our garden was squash, we always would cut it into thin slices and fry it in a skillet with some butter and make squash chips to eat.

                An easy recipe for dehydrating is one of my favorites are banana chips. They can be made by slicing a banana into about Â¼ inch slices, dipping them in lemon juice or pineapple juice, and drying until they have the correct texture at about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The downside to dehydrating is that it takes many hours which can stretch into days. Another easy way to preserve your excess from your garden is to can it.
