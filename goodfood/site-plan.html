        Growing a simple vegetable garden has some great benefits. If you have a family, it can become a family activity that you can all share in the fruits of your labors. Besides knowing where your food is coming from, there are several great health benefits. 

        One thing to keep in mind is that the food in the stores has had to travel to the store, also it has to be stored so it is covered in preservatives to help keep it fresher longer while it is in the store. Also, being able to decide what fertilizer to use if you choose to use any at all. 
        
        By growing it yourself, you also are able to control when you harvest your food, this allows you to get food that is fresh and ready to go. The vegetables being fresh, sometimes being picked moments before being used, will have a cleaner and wholesome taste to them. 
        
        With the troubling times that our world faces today, money tends to be on the forefront of most adults minds, growing your own food is a much more cost-effective way to get groceries.  A few things you can do with the excess is preserve it, or take it over to a neighbor and share with others.

      <h3>Preservation</h3>
      <p>
        There are a lot of ways to preserve foods for a long period of time, two of the most common are dehydrating and canning. 
        
        Dehydrating is one of the easiest ways to preserve foods. This can be done by purchasing an inexpensive dehydrator, or even in your own oven or out in the sun. The biggest trick to dehydrating anything is heat and airflow.  
        
        There are two main methods to canning, the first is water bath canning and the other is pressure canning. 
        
        Water bath canning is as simple as it sounds, just put the food items in a mason jar, put the lid and ring on, and put in the water bath to help sterilize and seal the jars. Unfortunately, water bath canning is not good low-acid foods like carrots; however, there are ways around that. By using vinegar or sometimes citric acid, you are able to get the acidity high enough that it is safe to can your vegetables, this process is called pickling. 
        
        Pressure canning can be used to can meats or low-acidic vegetables. This canning method uses heat and pressure to kill off any bacteria that maybe in the jars and seals them. This a commonly used method for making jams and jellies.

      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>
        Making food from your garden is a relatively easy process compared to the work that was put into growing and harvesting it. 
        
        A simple recipe to make with the vegetables that come from a home garden is a sheet pan dinner. The recipe I have used in the past is a mix of vegetables: broccoli, potatoes, green beans, bell peppers, cauliflower, and minced garlic. I usually go buy a smoked turkey sausage, and just cut it and the vegetables into bite sized pieces. Put on a sheet pan, add some finely cut parsley and oregano, and drizzle some extra virgin oil, and salt and pepper on the pile of food. Hand toss to coat everything evenly, and put in the oven at 400 until the vegetables are soft, stirring at least once during the cooking. Then just sprinkle some parmesan cheese over it and the meal is done with very little work or effort. 
        
        Something that was a staple from our garden was squash, we always would cut it into thin slices and fry it in a skillet with some butter and make squash chips to eat. 

        An easy recipe for dehydrating is one of my favorites are banana chips. They can be made by slicing a banana into about Â¼ inch slices, dipping them in lemon juice, and drying until they have the correct texture at about 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The downside to dehydrating is that it takes many hours which can stretch into days. Another easy way to preserve your excess from your garden is to can it.
